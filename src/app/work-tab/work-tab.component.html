    <p>Well you are looking at one example right now. This site is built on the stack we use. It was built in less than two weeks. It’s a single page web application but it’s also a progressive web app (PWA). <a href="#">Try it on your phone</a></p>
    <p>We build all of our prototypes as responsive, PWAs so it doesn’t matter whether the final product will be a site or a native app, the prototype experience will be the same.</p>
    <p>Much of our work is under NDA but here are a few (anonymized) peeks at what we’ve done <a href="#">(video).</a></p>
