            <li>We come to you, ask questions, talk to users, and identify the key need.</li>
            <li>We paper prototype a solution and iterate with you until you’re happy with it.</li>
            <li>We build the prototype with high fidelity design in real code, with mock data.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>What comes next?</h3>
          If you like, we will work with your RFP team (or help you find one), to prepare an RFP spec based on what we’ve built. At that point we can either step away and let you take it from there, or help you evaluate bidders, its up to you.
          <h3>Wait, you don’t want to bid?</h3>
          No, that’s not what we do. We make prototypes to help customers clarify a problem and solution, get buy in from leadership, and narrow the field to get the vendor they need. We don’t want to create your finished product, because of that you can trust us not to lobby for one vendor or technology stack.

          You could have a vendor create a POC, but you can guarantee that everything about that POC is going to be geared towards channeling the job towards the tools, processes, technologies, and budget, that suits the vendor. Or you could work with us to identify the user and business problems and solve them without any of that baggage.

          Well you are looking at one example right now. This site is built on the stack we use. It was built in less than two weeks. It’s a single page web application but it’s also a progressive web app (PWA). Try it on your phone.<br>
          We build all of our prototypes as responsive, PWAs so it doesn’t matter whether the final product will be a site or a native app, the prototype experience will be the same.<br>
          Much of our work is under NDA but here are a few (anonymized) peeks at what we’ve done (video).
